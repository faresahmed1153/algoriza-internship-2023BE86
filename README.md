when adding appointments of doctor time must be addedd like this this format 03:12:00 because i am using TimeOnly so any other format will not be parsed

there is a global exception middleware that's why i am not using too many try-catch blocks

i am seeding the data from json files you can find them in Repo layer

the configuration of relationships can be found also at repo layer inside data / config folder
